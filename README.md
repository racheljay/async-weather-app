# async-weather-app

## Requirements:

1. Allow the user to enter their location (zip code is probably easiest) and press a button to load the weather by creating an API GET request.
2. If the request is successful, display the following in a 'mobile app' format:
    - City Name
    - Current weather conditions
    - Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit and Celsius
    - A unique image, selected by the current temperature (the API has icons)
3. If the request is unsuccessful, display a specific error message
